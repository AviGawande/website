    <h3>Forking the Repository</h3>
    <p>
      Click the &quot;Fork&quot; button on our{' '}
      <a href="https://github.com/novuhq/novu/tree/next">GitHub repository</a> to create a copy of
      the project in your GitHub account. You will be making changes to your fork and then creating
      pull requests from there.{' '}
    </p>
    <p>
      By default, youâ€™ll be cloning the <code>next</code> branch. <code>next</code> is our
      development branch and it is recommended that you contribute to this branch only and not to{' '}
      <code>main</code> which is our production branch.
    </p>
    <h3>Cloning the Fork</h3>
    <p>Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        git <span>clone</span> <span>https</span>://github.com/novuhq/novu.git
      </code>
    </pre>
    <h2>Making Contributions</h2>
    <h3>Creating a New Branch</h3>
    <p>
      Before making changes, create a new branch for your contribution. Name your branch
      descriptively, such as &quot;fix-issue-123&quot; or &quot;feat-add-awesome-feature.&quot;
      Popular terminology to follow:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>build</li>
      <li>chore</li>
      <li>ci</li>
      <li>docs</li>
      <li>feat</li>
      <li>fix</li>
      <li>perf</li>
      <li>refactor</li>
      <li>revert</li>
      <li>style</li>
      <li>test</li>
    </ul>
    <pre>
      <code>
        git checkout -<span>b</span> your-branch-name
      </code>
    </pre>
    <h3>Making Changes</h3>
    <p>
      Make your desired changes to the codebase. To ensure consistency throughout the source code,
      please keep these rules in mind as you are working:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>All features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit tests).</li>
      <li>
        We use <a href="https://eslint.org/docs/rules/">Eslint default rule guide</a>, with minor
        changes. An automated formatter is available using prettier.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Committing Changes</h3>
    <p>
      Add the files youâ€™ve made changes in to git tracking and commit your changes with a clear and
      concise message. Use the present tense and provide context about what your commit does.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        git <span>add</span>
        <span> fileName</span>
        <span># To add all the files you've made changes in, you can also use: "git add ."</span>
        git commit -m <span>"feat: Description of your changes"</span>
      </code>
    </pre>
    <h3>Pushing Changes</h3>
    <p>Push your branch to your fork on GitHub:</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        git <span>push</span> <span>origin</span> your-branch-name
      </code>
    </pre>
    <h2>Opening Pull Requests</h2>
    <h3>Creating a Pull Request</h3>
    <p>
      Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub and click the &quot;New Pull Request&quot;
      button. Select the base repository and branch (select our development branch <code>next</code>{' '}
      here) you want to merge your changes into.
    </p>
    <h3>Writing a Good Pull Request Description</h3>
    <p>
      A good PR description is one that explains what your changes accomplish and provides context.
      For your ease, whenever you create a new Pull Request, youâ€™ll automatically see a template
      with some questions about your pull request. Ensure that you answer those as best as you can
      and include screenshots and screencasts wherever you can.
    </p>
    <h3>Review Process</h3>
    <p>
      Your pull request will undergo review by the core Novu team members. They may suggest changes,
      refer to a different issue or request clarifications. Be responsive and open to feedback. Once
      approved, your contribution will be merged into the project. ðŸŽ‰
